# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on developing a seamless integration between the Laravel backend and React frontend systems to serve the application through the index route. The implementation will ensure the frontend is properly bundled and served by the backend server when accessing the root path ('/'), while handling routing, static file serving, and API requests efficiently with clean separation of concerns between the two layers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the application through a single domain and port, so that I have a unified experience without dealing with separate frontend and backend URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the root path ('/') THEN the system SHALL serve the React frontend application
2. WHEN a user accesses any frontend route THEN the system SHALL serve the React application with proper client-side routing
3. WHEN the frontend build files exist THEN the system SHALL serve them from the Laravel public directory
4. IF the frontend build files do not exist THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend build process to integrate seamlessly with the Laravel backend, so that deployment and development workflows are streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is built THEN the system SHALL output files to the Laravel public directory
2. WHEN assets are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them with proper MIME types and caching headers
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL generate optimized bundles for production
4. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL support hot module replacement and fast refresh

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want API requests to work seamlessly from the frontend, so that I can interact with backend services without CORS issues or complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN the system SHALL handle them through the same domain
2. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL distinguish them from frontend routes
3. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN API requests succeed THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper static file serving, so that assets load efficiently and the application performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static assets are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them with appropriate cache headers
2. WHEN images, CSS, or JS files are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them with correct MIME types
3. WHEN assets are missing THEN the system SHALL return 404 errors gracefully
4. WHEN the system serves static files THEN it SHALL support compression for better performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the integration to maintain clean separation of concerns, so that the backend and frontend can be developed and maintained independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend serves the frontend THEN it SHALL not interfere with admin routes
2. WHEN admin routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL serve the Filament admin interface
3. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL not serve frontend files
4. WHEN the system routes requests THEN it SHALL follow a clear priority order (admin > API > static files > frontend fallback)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routing errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately
2. WHEN file serving fails THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages
3. WHEN the frontend build is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain proper error response format

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work correctly in both development and production environments, so that I have a consistent experience across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL support live reloading and development tools
2. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL serve optimized and minified assets
3. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL adapt its behavior accordingly
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL have a clear build and deployment process
